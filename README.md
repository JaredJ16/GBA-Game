Arcade GBA Game

"Carl" is a block based arcade game that I made in C that can be run on a GBA emulator. I made this game as an open ended project for a class, so I am unable to share the code. I really spent a lot of time on this, going way above the requirements and I felt it would be cool to at least share a video.

The objective is to control the green block and take down as many red blocks as possible by shooting projectiles either to the left, downwards, or to the right. The green block needs to avoid both the red blocks and its own projectiles in order to survive. The score you get at the end is based on the amount of red blocks you can take down before you get hit. In the game, there is a orange and blue portal both of which that work differently that make the game a lot more challenging and fun.

Here is a youtube link to the game:
